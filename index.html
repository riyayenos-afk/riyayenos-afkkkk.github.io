    <!-- introduction text -->
    <p class="homepageintrotext"> I've always been interested in art, having purchased my first sketchbook at the age of 10, I've continued my hobby for approximately <i>four years</i> now. I mainly like to focus on capturing moments and people, as I find beauty and personality in humans. Having explored creation for so long, I have additionally indulged in many forms of media, and have gathered a fairly <i>large</i> collection of supplies in my room. I will be rating my experience with each of these supplies, and how much I reccomend them to other other people.</p>
